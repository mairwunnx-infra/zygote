## Project Overview

This repository provides infrastructure automation for server setup and management. It includes a comprehensive initialization script that configures Ubuntu/Debian servers with Docker, IPv6 networking, and security hardening. The project focuses on automated server provisioning with Docker containerization and network security features, specifically UDP flood protection via iptables rules.

## Technology Stack

- **Shell Scripting**: Bash scripts for automated server configuration
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container orchestration and management (Docker CE 2.33.2+)
- **Portainer**: Web-based Docker management interface (v2.33.2)
- **Linux**: Ubuntu/Debian-based systems (kernel 6.8.0+)
- **Networking**: IPv6 with custom subnet configuration, dual-stack networking
- **Security**: iptables/ip6tables for UDP flood mitigation, hashlimit module for rate limiting
- **System Tools**: systemd, sysctl, chrony (NTP), swap management
